# About
this design pattern emphasis making your project in terms of:
1. provider component: it is a component that acts as a wrapper around not only a child but the whole tree where it has used at, it is a way to have a control over the whole sub-components tree
2. consumer components: they are the components that have been wrapped by the provider component


# Note
this pattern is like making a context, but this time it is a provider component, this pattern is not strictly a design pattern.

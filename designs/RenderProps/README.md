# About
this design pattern emphasis making your project in terms of:
1. provider component: it is a component that provides data or props so it can be rendered later, it is similar to container component where it encapsulates the logic
2. render props component: it is a component utilised in provider component, it uses its props and render it, it is similar to presentation component where it shows the data to clients


# Note
this pattern could be represented in two layers or with three layers, the first layer is the provider layer, the second layer is the intermediate[bridge] layer, and the third layer is the render props layer
